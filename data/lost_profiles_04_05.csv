Sally Hussey,['English'],"Hello,

I'm a freelance copywriter, editor and PR manager. I'm also one of PPH's top rated sellers, with 100% positive reviews, so you can count on me to do a great job!

If you need someone who not only creates great content but understands business and social media, I'm here to make your life easier. As well as being creative, I was a project manager for many years so I understand business, hate time wasting and have a real understanding of how to market yourself to find work or reach more customers. I'm educated to Degree level and hold a Diploma in Digital Marketing, and I'm also a qualified tutor with experience of working with a huge range of people.

I understand how to use SEO keywords and meta tags in a way that will bring traffic to your site without sounding clunky or contrived. I'm confident with Yoast and Wordpress, having uploaded countless product descriptions and somehow managing to make them all sound different - not always easy!
 
I create engaging, clear copy that's targeted to your audience and says what you need to without waffle and in plain English. I love writing About Us pages, Freewall Advertising campaigns and using storytelling to create marketing content. I also really enjoy coming up with punchy taglines. 

I've written about pretty much everything, but my main areas of specialisim are food,  property, lifestyle and tech. I work regularly with London agencies and my clients range from small start ups to big multi national IT firms.

I provide a fast, friendly, professional service with honesty and integrity. If you work with me I can promise 100% commitment. All my reviews are positive and I believe that's largely down to my customer care skills (and hopefully my writing!!)

I do not outsource my work; everything I do is written solely by me, which is why you'll always get a fast response and a personal service. Unlike some other copywriters, who simply Google articles and regurgitate them so they get through online plagiarism  checking tools, I undertake thorough research on every topic. That means you’ll be guaranteed a totally original piece of work that won’t land you in hot water with other companies and journalists. Good copywriting is never about “copying”; it’s about finding a new angle and creating engaging work that really represents your business. My online portfolio is 100% genuine and I'm happy to provide references, original copies or direct you to the links.

I love the challenge of adapting my skills to write effective words for a wide variety of industries, businesses and publications. I love helping people who don’t share my passion to hone their own words, meticulously checking them for accuracy and tone until they sparkle.

Even though things are not easy I learned how to stay focused and keep the time frame in order to satisfy the costumer. 

I’m a reliable and honest person. I will always try my best, stay focused and positive. Since I spend some time in English speaking countries I’m fluent in word and speech in that language and German as my mother language, that is a good mixture.

Mauricio Casasbuenas,"['English', 'Spanish']","I am a freelance translator since 2009. 
I built my professional career at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana at Bogota, Colombia and I specialized in Health Management at the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano also at Bogota.
My schooling was carried out, first (from third-grade primary school) at the Panama Canal Zone, when it was a North American Military Base and later I finished my High School at Sacred Heart High School in San Francisco, California. This school formation, and living in San Francisco for more than three years, gave me an English fluidity as if it were my native language.
I directed the health area of a medical second opinion company, in which one of my duties was to gather and translate medical records with all the examination reports, and translate them from Spanish to English, and send them to an interdisciplinary group of expert, specialized physicians, in the United States. Then, when the experts delivered their assessment reports and management suggestions I translated them from English to Spanish. This included some articles published in medical journals that supported the reports. As the company grew we hired other translators and I added to my responsibilities the proofreading of their translations.
Besides my experience in translation in the health sector, I have worked as a freelance translator for​ 4C Coffee Growers Association, based in Holland, and Ludum Locus (a company that sells online on ETSY). One of the largest and most exciting jobs as a freelance translator was the translation of a more than 600-page book by Dean Ornish: ""Reversing Heart Disease"".

Sebastian Ursuta,"['English', 'French', 'Romanian']","Architect turned out copywriter.

Does this seem odd?

Far from it. Let me tell you why. 

Architecture is not about learning how to build. Is about understanding the needs of the people you need to build for. Apart from all the technical aspects of architecture, I learned how people think, how they interact with what`s in front of them and most of all, I learned what makes them click. 

Needless to way that this skills proved golden when I shifted my career to copywriting. 

Since then I did copywriting on projects from different industries: medical, entertainment, engineering, self-help, HoReCa etc.

And because a copywriter`s job is to write that message that clicks with the customer and makes him buy, my passion for pshychology did the trick. 

But that is not all. I strongly believe that a copywriter must also know a lot of marketing. You can`t write for the market if you don`t understand how it works. And it is fascinating after you understand it. 

Yet the best part for me are not the practical skills I acquired, but rather the soft skills. Understanding people helps me build strong working and personal relationships with them.

Janette Bryant,['English'],"Hi, I 'm a Top Cert rated freelance website usability professional, gained from working with nearly 500 happy clients on pph. I've gained my broad website testing experience from working on hundreds (probably thousands!) of different websites. 

I help website owners by critically analysing their website and feeding back my opinion on the website design, engagement, clarity and navigation. I show how a 'typical' customer may behave on the site pointing out where they may lose interest, get confused or what may hold them back from placing an order or enquiry. I don't hold back, so if you want to hear everything is ok with your site - don't hire me!!

My approach is simple; from an unbiased perspective I visit your site  with a fresh pair of eyes. I video my screen and voice, whilst I use the site and narrate my thoughts, suggesting improvements as I go. I will look at various aspects from engagement, clarity, trustworthiness and persuasion to contact/buy. I can also proofread the site and review web content. You then get the video and a report summarising my experience and recommendations.

I use many e-commerce sites on a daily basis and have a broad experience of all website types in the internet marketplace. I can also test mobile sites and apps on ipad and iphone.

Polly Barker,"['Spanish', 'Italian', 'Portuguese']","I am a languages postgraduate with a passion for writing! 

After completing my MA in Modern Languages and Cultures in October of 2020, I was adamant to pursue a job which exercised my creativity and in which I could express my love of writing. I had spent the last year researching, writing, editing long pieces of work and I was keen to find a way to develop my passion for words and language into a career. I volunteered briefly at the end of my MA on a small project with a local charity in Manchester which required me to write copy for digital manuals for volunteers implementing workshops with youths in the area. Having had some former experience of writing copy in a more administrative environment – emails, internal communications, reports, etc. – I was incredibly pleased to find a role which allowed me to build on these writing skills and which required me to embody an organisation’s tone of voice and values in my work. 

After this project ended, I decided to pursue this route of copywriting and digital content marketing and I took up a role as a Media and Communications Officer with small start-up queer womxn’s streaming platform, Lesflicks. At Lesflicks, I fulfilled a lot of digital marketing tasks, frequently creating visual and written content for press releases, social media, blog pieces, etc. I even wrote a piece on World Aids Day last December which was picked up and published by several queer magazines across the globe. Having to produce lots of different types of writing on a variety of topics required me to thoroughly exercise my creativity and helped me develop my ability to self-manage deadlines and prioritise tasks. Above all, I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to gain experience in copywriting for promotional campaigns and marketing and I was very grateful to learn more about how to write engaging, persuasive copy with a brand which appealed to such a vast, diverse demographic. 

I am also versed in creating artwork for social media accounts as I manage the graphics for the Instagram of a small candle shop, Blessed Bee Boutique - @blessedbeeboutiqueuk

Joy Ngesa,"['English', 'French']","Hey there! thank you for taking the time to go through my profile, I've been writing articles and blog posts for over 5 years now. I just love this stuff. If it was a drug I'd probably be broke trying to pay for it. Thankfully I get paid to write instead!

I’m a savvy SEO writer who will help you optimize your posts to rank higher on search engines.

Most writers get it all wrong when you tell them to write an SEO optimized blog post. What they do is to keyword stuff the article making it sound like an academic essay – so annoying!

Writers forget that keyword insertion shouldn’t be overdone. Instead, it should act as a spice that adds flavor to your article. Meaning overdoing it is like adding too much salt to your stew.

On the contrary, I follow a clear path to optimizing my clients’ articles. Here’s my process:

Research relevant keywords
Use various tools to generate long-tail keywords
Write down both the primary keyword and the long-tail keywords
Plan subheadings using the long-tail keywords
Write the article while naturally inserting both the primary keyword as well as the long-tail keywords (0.5-1% of the total word count for the primary keyword. Long-tail keywords can appear once.)
Use the Yoast Plugin to check if your SEO score is perfect (the icon should turn green.)
Edit the permalinks and meta description box. Use your keyword on the permalink. Remove unnecessary characters like dates from your permalink.
Publish the post

I’ll be happy to see you soaring in search engines.

I can make ads that would advertise you and your company. It takes me 1-8 days to make 1-4 consecutive ads. To be more specific, I make infographics, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, ad campaigns, and I’m in the midst of learning how to make animated and video ads. My style of art is modern, minimalistic, and traditional. I use Adobe Photoshop and Canva to make my ads, but I am more experienced with Canva. You can see all my artwork on my profile.

 I have experience in speaking multiple languages including ASL (American Sign Language), German, and Spanish.

Donna Martin,['English'],"I won't make you suffer through another bog-standard, boring bio about my career experience; no one wants to read that drivel, so let's get straight to the fun stuff!

If you're tired of the same ol' same ol' and might throw something if you read another PPH bio using phrases like ""extensive experience"", ""high-quality copy"" or ""gets results"", I might just be your gal. Now, I'm not saying I don't offer those things; I'm saying you need a whole lot more than that. You need personality, intellect, spirit, creativity and truly inspiring, conversational writing to establish your product, service or brand as the best amongst the rest.

With over 20 years under my belt in B2B and B2C writing roles of all flavours – from editorial director at multiple luxury lifestyle magazines to marketing copywriter at a global real estate firm – I'm a British American dual citizen and can write effortlessly for US, UK and global audiences, in print and online. My clients have told me I'm pretty fabulous at research-driven projects, even more fabulous at lifestyle copy, and my friends roll their eyes at my insufferable grammar snobbery, but that can only be a good thing for you, right?

Low-cost, run-of-the-mill isn't my thing, so if you're looking for a writer who can pump out 1,000 flaccid words for £20, we probably won't be a good match. Instead, if you're looking for someone with that written word je ne sais quoi, let's chat.

Rumours had ruined my will to finish school and study, but thanks to my amazing Gr 9 English teacher, I found a way to escape my nightmare at school. I started writing and planning my future, and to be honest, my plans kept changing until I realized that I am not the type to just ""go with the flow"". I didn't want to take the steps that the rest of the world expected me to, and so I didn't! 
I graduated high school and studied feature journalism through the get smarter division of The University of Cape Town. After I finished studying journalism, I started working as a freelancer. 
Presently I am Studying Digital Photography, finishing in November 2020! I am also a new mommy to be! With that said, family values are extremely important to me! As a human with a curious mind, I am very eager to learn new skills and gain knowledge of new subjects/ projects.

Tony K,['English'],"I am an ex-recruiter and HR manager with 6 years of industry experience, screening thousands of CVs and cover letters for employers, coaching candidates for interviews, and listening to feedback from hiring managers on who they liked and who they didn't and why. 

There are a few things I can tell you right now that may help you land that dream job:

1) CVs should be no longer than two pages and always in Word - especially if you're working with a recruiter because they will need to reformat your CV to the specifications of their clients and they hate having to convert PDFs.

2) The more qualified applicants there are for a role, the more important your cover letter becomes as this is what hiring managers will use to decide who to bring in for an interview if they have to start choosing between people - a good one should have only 4-5 paragraphs, highlighting your most 'relevant' achievements and your reason for applying. The number of people who think the purpose of a cover letter is to re-write their CV is essay form is truly shocking.

3) Preparing for interviews is all about examples, examples, examples, and the key to preparing for them is focusing almost exclusively on the top two or three items of the person specification (not the role description) - then asking yourself two questions: how can I prove I know how to do that; and why is it important to doing this job well?

If you can do all these things by yourself, then have at it and good luck, but if you need help and a second set of eyes to check you're doing them right, then get in touch - I'd love to hear from you. Simply drop me a line and tell me what you need and I'll tell you what I can do and how long I think it will take, then you decide if you want to go ahead. 

Typical timescales and costs for the services people usually ask for include:

- Proofreading a CV 'or' cover letter and making suggestions for improvement: 1 hour (£50)
- Proofreading both CV 'and' cover letter and making suggestions for improvement: 2 hours (£100)
- Partial interview prep - reviewing person specification and making notes only: 1 hour (£50)
- Interview coaching - partial interview prep + mock interviews and feedback: 3 hours min (£150)

All offers come with a free 30 minute phone/video consultation before you buy to help you work out what you need.

Ori Hasmanto,"['English', 'Indonesian']","I graduated from Jenderal Soedirman University ( State University) in Purwokerto, Central Java. I began to study in 1992 and was inaugurated as Bachelor Administration/Economics majoring in Management in 1997. 
My experiences are not much. After several years I finished my study, I took a job in Government Organisation namely Dekopinda ( Dewan Koperasi Indonesia Daerah) at Purbalingga Region for one and a half years. But I do not tell this experience. I was .quite for finding a new job then.
Then I met a friend who worked as a consultant, he told me about some vacant positions. When I heard and remarked all information, it suited my background. So, I decided to apply. It was in the year 2008 I was admitted to be a consultant after 3 months of waiting. I joined an Indonesian Government National Project as an Economics/Finance Consultant. I shall in the project as Economics/Finance Consultant for almost 11 years. I will tell you what my job was.
In the year 2008, the Indonesian Government was launching a National Programme namely the National Program of Poverty Eradication (P2KP). The program was launched under the President of Megawati Sukarno Putri after replacing Abdurrahman Wahid. The P2KP is under the Kementerian Pekerjaan Umum dan Perumahan Rakyat program, The first assignment was in Boyolali Regency. I had moved the workplace at least three times. The second opportunity I was moved to Purbalingga and the last I was moved to Banjarnegara Regency till I did not succeed selection for further assignment in 2020 because of restructuration policy. 
There is two consultant main task. Number one is the empowerment task and number two is the project task. Kementerian PUPR has the pattern to make poverty decreased in Indonesia. The selected regions are a target of the P2KP. 
The first worked as a consultant is established a grass-root institution i.e The Community Self-Reliance Institution or LKM. The LKM is a proxy of all village people's awareness. The LKM institutions consist of 13 members and 30% shall be women members, it is the representation of gender fairness. You know that most social matters are women as the object. The LKM main task is observing and promoting poverty in their territory to get P2KP execution. The LKM builds some sections to help ie UPK ( Finance Business Unit), UPL ( Infrastructure Section Unit), and UPS ( Social Section Unit). It used to be regularly, the government disbursed P2KP fund it was called BLM ( Direct Fund for Community). The disbursement purpose is developing the poverty region through infrastructure, economy, and social interfere. My job as an economic consultant some are improving the economic capability of the poor whose small business to emerge, to establish a strong KSM ( Community Recipient Group) through implementing 5 KSM rules. We called it Panca Sutra. It is routine meeting, administration, intern loan, installment, and savings. I used to arrive at the KSM house secretariat for RLF( Revolving Loan Fund) disbursement together UPK. The disbursement fund for KSM shall obey SOP ( Standard Operating Procedures) that 60 % women recipient. I gave some speeches to KSM members to benefit the fund just for business, to develop business, diversity product, doing Panca Sutra deeply so the family earning increases, and family economics goes higher. Besides assisting KSM my job to help the LKM Secretary administration and the UPK bookkeeping. My busy time came when the BLM arrived and shall be organized well. The Secretary activity in early of the year should staff a Budget and Expenses Report. I help the secretary to plan the LKM activity years ahead. And of course envoy Secretary bookkeeping accountable. The report of the secretary administration shall be informed in monthly LKM meetings such as Ballance Sheet, Cash Flow, meeting agenda, and progress on a running program. In the middle of the escorting secretary, I should envoy UPK too. UPK accounting is more rigid than the secretary. The UPK maintains the RLF business should reach an adequate Repayment Rate (RR). The program has tools to examine UPK business. The UPK also has an obligation to attend the LKM monthly meeting. The UPK financial reports consist of a Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Collectibility RLF. I used to monitor, evaluate, and report UPK financial conditions to the national website for uploading.  The LKM shall attend and conduct a financial audit by CPA every year. It is a realization of the transparency and accountability aspect of the project needs.
We turn to BLM. The LKM shall benefit the BLM for infrastructure, economic, and social. The use of the BLM must be reported to BLM SIM( Management Information System) where the coming in the fund shall the same amount of coming out fund. At the end of time, the fund shall be reported to the central consultant program. As the economic consultant, my task is assisting the LKM to organize accountability reports. 
The LKM got training funds from the program too. The consultant team consists of a senior consultant, economic consultant, social consultant, and technic consultant made preparation to hold the capacity building. We used to hold a consultant meeting every week. Our task is as the trainer. The capacity material teaching is chosen from the PMU(Program Management Unit). It is different between program training to school training. Our model learning is creating the participants as the subject, they are not only participants but also a mentor. The Focused Group Discussion is a very popular method to realize it. When there is an issue about UPK  I shall guide the FGD as a trainer whereas all the participants are UPK personnel or the KSM economics I was a trainer in UPK capacity building at the time my FGD materials are entrepreneurship, Household economic management, Revolving Loan Fund, UPK bookkeeping, etc. I am not only a trainer for economic but also general topics, that is another consultant obligation. As the trainer, I wore the best cloth I have.  Thank God, I did the task well and held the trainer as the SOP syllabus asked for. The several important things that should be acknowledged are the pictures, attending list, and bills. Those are important for making accountability reports. We must obey KPI (Keys Performance Indicator) rules that indicate that women's participation in capacity training shall reach 40%.  Besides that, I become a contributor writer, I shall write bulletin content every month.
There are three consultant functions ie to advocate, to facilitate, and to mediate. Holding the three functions could make our job and responsibility clearer. I used to do some activities to run the team. I am computer literate, good in windows programs, MS Word and Excel, Powerpoint, internet, video making, team administration, archiving the letters in and out, reports. From the beginning until the end of the contract. I had several times of supervisor replacement.",0.0,0,15.0,"['financial accounting', 'administration support', 'finance consulting', 'data entry', 'content writing', 'training development']","['advertising', 'education', 'financial services', 'internet', 'publishing']",0,0,15-03-2021,unknown,Surabaya, Indonesia,0.0,26-04-2021

Irene Kiragu,"['English', 'Swahili']","A writer with an excellent style accompanied by imaginative writing to catch one's eye, ready and up for any challenge in article writing.
A proofreader with an ability to discern smallest errors like an eagle's eye (a keen skill of observation).
An editor who is keen on mistakes made and corrects them by constructing clear and simple words to understand to ensure my client gets satisfied with my feedback.
Experience; I have done proofreading and editing jobs during my days the university to my fellow students before submitting their course projects. I have also participated in academic writing.
Here is my sample in academic writing;
According to Lord Action, “power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” In reference to Iraq.

Introduction

   Power tends to make an individual feel that he or she is all knowing and doesn’t depend on any other person below him in making of any decision especially when the ideas don’t go in line with theirs. This makes an individual to end up being corrupt and a dictator simultaneously where the effect is also felt by the surroundings. Individuals in positions of power tend to use it for their own personal gains and their agendas rendering others their subjects by bringing them under their  control or jurisdiction, typically by using force.  Increase in more power will then result to more corruption thus confirming the statement above as Lord Action states.

 The ideas of corruption can be found in notional novels like animal farm (by George Orwell) where other farm animals end up being oppressed by their fellow former associate whose name  Napoleon. Napoleon  confirms to be power hungry and becomes a totalitarian dictator where he vehemently disagrees with Snowball ideas in making the farm convenient and comfortable for the rest of the farm animals, hence ends up eliminating him by summoning a pack of ferocious dogs. He does this despite the efforts of  Snowball of giving a hand in overthrowing their human dictator Mr. Jones. It clearly shows that Napoleon possessed  absolute power which led to corruption as he does according to what is best for him without other animals considerations.

   Iraq is one of the countries which suffered in the hands of a leader whose government was involved in pure corruption and dictatorship due to power  and absolute power in a period of  more than 20 years. This resulted to ignorance of human rights of the nation’s citizens.

Saddam Hussein was the president during those years of  pain and anguish. Hussein took over leadership from his cousin who led for 11 years by planning several coups which he attempted severally by painting his cousin a dictator in July 1968 where he later succeeded. (History.com Editors). During his 24 years in power, Saddam secret police ended up being charged for causing  panic to the public which ended up dimining human rights in the country. He  lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the nation’s citizens where he ended up building more than 20 lavish hotels where he secretly moved around.. In 1980 as Saddam was still in power which meant that more humanity towards the public was something he never considered, he ended up making his country get involved in an eight-year war with Iran which resulted to vast loss of life with an approximate of 1million from both parties. His act of inhumanity continues being shown when he was ready and fast to acquire deadly weapons and substances like chemical weapons on Iraq’s own Kurdish population in Northern Iraq in 1988 and nerve agents and mustard gas on in Iranian soldiers respectively during the conflict.

   He then invaded Kuwait in 1988 where the US-led coalition decision to invade Iraq was to clear its army in their neighboring small country and failed the probe of removing Saddam Hussein from power in 1991. This was the beginning of his government being crippled that resulted to his hiding after US invaded his country in 2003 until he was captured    five months later which was on  December 13  2003,by U.S  Soldiers. He was then found guilty of crimes charged against him on November 2006 and later he was executed December 30,2006.

According to Lord Action’s statement above  it can be clearly be evidenced  in Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq. The more he got more power the more corrupt he became.
