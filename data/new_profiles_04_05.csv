Sally Evatt,['English'],"Hello,

I'm a freelance copywriter, editor and PR manager. I'm also one of PPH's top rated sellers, with 100% positive reviews, so you can count on me to do a great job!

If you need someone who not only creates great content but understands business and social media, I'm here to make your life easier. As well as being creative, I was a project manager for many years so I understand business, hate time wasting and have a real understanding of how to market yourself to find work or reach more customers. I'm educated to Degree level and hold a Diploma in Digital Marketing, and I'm also a qualified tutor with experience of working with a huge range of people.

I understand how to use SEO keywords and meta tags in a way that will bring traffic to your site without sounding clunky or contrived. I'm confident with Yoast and Wordpress, having uploaded countless product descriptions and somehow managing to make them all sound different - not always easy!
 
I create engaging, clear copy that's targeted to your audience and says what you need to without waffle and in plain English. I love writing About Us pages, Freewall Advertising campaigns and using storytelling to create marketing content. I also really enjoy coming up with punchy taglines. 

I've written about pretty much everything, but my main areas of specialisim are food,  property, lifestyle and tech. I work regularly with London agencies and my clients range from small start ups to big multi national IT firms.

I provide a fast, friendly, professional service with honesty and integrity. If you work with me I can promise 100% commitment. All my reviews are positive and I believe that's largely down to my customer care skills (and hopefully my writing!!)

I do not outsource my work; everything I do is written solely by me, which is why you'll always get a fast response and a personal service. Unlike some other copywriters, who simply Google articles and regurgitate them so they get through online plagiarism  checking tools, I undertake thorough research on every topic. That means you’ll be guaranteed a totally original piece of work that won’t land you in hot water with other companies and journalists. Good copywriting is never about “copying”; it’s about finding a new angle and creating engaging work that really represents your business. My online portfolio is 100% genuine and I'm happy to provide references, original copies or direct you to the links.

TS Web Technologies,"['English', 'Spanish']","I am Tapash Dutta, Co-founder and Director of TS Web Technologies Pvt Ltd. Our company can definitely help you to achieve Google page 1 rankings for the key phrases that are going to deliver the best and the quickest return on your investment.

BUT PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE OUR WORLD CLASS SEO & AUTHORITY BUILDING WITH CHEAP AUTOMATED ALTERNATIVES…. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME !!!

We apologies for making that point so strongly but so many customers are caught out by eye catching offers of a cheap price, not realising that this is usually going to do far more harm to their site than good.

SEO can't any longer be achieved for a few pounds with automated software. If you want SEO that works today and consistently drives top rankings for the key phrases that are most valuable to your business, then you need to use the unique White Hat SEO provided by TSwebtechnologies.com, which does absolutely everything needed to achieve Google page 1 rankings.

Trying to cut corners or save money by using cheap overseas back link builders, some spun content and a blog nobody reads is simply a false economy… 
You will only either end up with lesser key phrases that will not drive the large quantities of high quality traffic to your site that you want… 
Or you may target the right keywords but end up with Page 3 and lower rankings that are basically pointless in terms of SEO results and will have no benefit to your business whatsoever. 

Google Is Not Stupid!

Google knows the difference between organic SEO and “forced” SEO
They KNOW when you're cheating
They KNOW when you're automating
They KNOW when you’re creating hundreds of worthless links
They KNOW when you're flooding the internet with duplicate content 

The bottomline is… They KNOW when you’re not doing the job properly in an effort to save money and circumvent what they want !

And Here's The Crazy Thing...

... GIVING GOOGLE WHAT THEY WANT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE
You just need to be willing to put in the time and effort required to make it happen !

Google LOVES what we do because it’s Organic, it’s Natural and it’s Relevant. We give them what they want and they’re then happy to give us what we want in return.

And No Client of ours has EVER been negatively affected by any Google upgrade !!!

By employing our services you're going to get access to over 20 years of testing, failing, tripping, winning, trying... and everything else we've needed to refine our services to guarantee your success.

And if you are unsure in any way about the true value of any investment, just take a look at the unedited and independent 5 Star client testimonials right here on People Per Hour in recognition of our services.

We turn projects around on-time every-time, providing 10 years of proven success, should tell you everything you need to know about the value we bring to your business.

We may not be the cheapest but trying to save a few pounds using completely ineffective SEO and pointless outdated methods, is simply a false economy that will only cost you thousands later in wasted potential and significantly reduced profits.

So please don’t fall into the potentially fatal trap of comparing our services to cheaper companies and pointless overseas link builders that can’t actually deliver the Page 1 rankings you both want and need.

Just get in touch and let us provide World Class SEO and Authority Building that will deliver the significant quantities of highly targeted traffic you’re looking for.

Mohammad Kashif Inayat,['English'],"Hi dear,
I am a Harvard MBA, CFA Chart holder and VC-backed Technology Company Founder with a comprehensive finance (private equity and, investment banking) and writing background.
Professional Background:
I started my career in investment banking at a bulge bracket investment bank in New York working on sell- & buy-side M&A and debt/equity financing engagements. After this experience, I worked for a top-tier, middle-market generalist private equity firm and invested over $100M of equity capital across several deals. Over the years, I've analyzed hundreds of businesses and invested in several companies. For these deals, I led a fair amount of business, financial and legal due diligence. After business school, I founded a technology company that has raised $1M+ from institutional investors on both coasts. In the process, I have helped fellow entrepreneurs raise millions of dollars in equity capital to fund start-ups and/or growth ventures. Some of the clients have been placed at prestigious accelerator programs. This work is primarily via writing and reviewing business plans and helping talented entrepreneurs reach angel or seed investors. also, have experience writing and reviewing business plans.
Outside of my professional experience, I am also a published writer and a journalist. During my time at HBS, I served as the Finance and Economics Editor of the Harbus Newspaper, a publication that reaches a worldwide audience. I also published a thesis related to hedge funds and private equity firms within the broader Alternative Asset Management Industry. I have helped faculty at leading universities publish books, academic journals, and research pieces.
Right now, I am working as a professor cum director of the document with several publications and technical writings under my belt. There are several firms that I have served to write technical documents. It includes a wide range of documents. They include instructions, reviews, reports, newsletters, presentations, web pages, brochures, proposals, business plan, product description; SEO content, travel articles, script writings, letters, fliers, graphics, memos, press releases, handbooks, specifications, style guides, agendas and so on.

A lot of people who come to PPH  have websites and often go to SEO companies for help!

There's nothing wrong with that, in fact, it's quite a sensible thing to do! Especially if you're a novice! BUT what you probably don't realise is that those SEO companies then come to people like me to write content to improve your ranking position.

Written website content should be a part of every website owners 'content marketing strategy' and that's why it's also a part of search engine optimisation strategies. 

I guess hiring me is pretty much like cutting out the middle man! And, the content me and my team produce is so good, that even the SEO companies who hire us to write for you, also get us to write for them! 

That means, the chances are, that SEO company you just found on the top of google, has had some of their content written by me or my team members! 

If you're an agency then me and my team can write hundreds of thousands of words for you every week
- Long Form 
- Short Form 
- With Diagrams
- Without Diagrams 

And everyone is treated equally - I know, it's shocking right! Who'd have thunk it! 

So How Is The Content Written & Delivered?
- We use Grammarly to ensure the best writing
- We then check it's plagiarism free
- It's pasted into Google Docs 
- 3+ Images Per Document (with ALT tags in place) are added
- Page title & Meta Description Included at the top of the page (not included in the word count) 
- All H1, H2, H3, H4 tags are put in place 
- We then add in some high authority links 
- Add the content onto your content marketing board that we set up for you on Asana or Trello (or your preferred method) 

What we don't do:
- Don't upload, edit or publish directly on to anyone's websites (this is not the job we are used to doing sorry, that's on you) 

What We Ensure We'll Do For You: 
- WRITE ENOUGH CONTENT AND OPTIMISE IT TO ENSURE IT RANKS
- MAKE SURE IT FLOWS WELL
- KEEP THE READER ENGAGED 
- USE IMAGES AS WELL AS TEXT 
- DON'T GIVE THE READER A REASON TO CLICK THE BACK BUTTON
- CONVERT VISITORS WITH DISCREET BUT EFFECTIVE CALL-TO ACTIONS 
- PROMPT READERS TO COMMENT, LIKE, SHARE, SUBSCRIBE 

What Content Writing & Content Media Means To Me & My team?
Content isn't just text that fills a site, it's written to outrank competitors, to magically make websites appear when someone asks google to find them the answers to the most complex questions in the world and to give businesses an online presence so superior that they get more monthly visitors than their competitors. 

SO
If that sounds like something you want, if you can handle the extra traffic that superior written content will bring to your site and if you don't mind making probably double if not tripple what you're earning now then maybe you should get in touch.

Having started a family, being away from home with my previous job was increasingly tough. I had always been attracted to the 'idea' of being a freelancer – the freedom and the ability to help people and businesses on a more personal level – but I wasn’t sure if I could turn that idea into a reality.

Some people get frozen with indecision.

I would rather fail than not try.

So that’s what I did.

I am known for unprecedented levels of ambition, drive and client service, I have fuelled marketing strategies from the ground up and become one of the fastest rising stars within the marketing industry. Currently, I provide top-notch creativity, analytical thinking and data metrics for companies seeking next-level growth.

Behind my vibrant, friendly personality is a high-energy professional with deep familiarity in forecasting, budgeting and maintaining a results-driven path to success. I thrive off forging new relationships and constantly building my network, and she loves nothing more than sharing my expertise in helping companies maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly-evolving information age. My professionalism and expertise, coupled with strong charisma and confidence, help me bring out the best in clients which in turn help me understand their goals.

Thinking outside the box, building innovative campaigns, and never losing focus are probably the most commonly-used descriptions you’ll hear when someone describes me and my company. Among my many core competencies, growth strategy development is by and large my biggest strength, as it encompasses a whole suite of skills that not only boost a client’s profile and revenue. These include around-the-clock competitor analysis, new media and technology strategies, monitoring target markets and keeping KPIs synchronised in order to stay a cut above the competition.

I have established myself as a trusted partner for an ever-increasing list of satisfied clients. As an eager lover of learning, and with well-earned trust from companies large and small, I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to apply my passions to growing businesses and exploring all the wonderful ways marketing and improved business practices can make the world a better place.

As a marketing expert I primarily focus on:

- Online Marketing
- Funnels
- Growth Hacking Marketing
- Social Selling
- Lead Generation
- Organic Growth

Belinda Orphanou,['English'],"Finding your first job after graduation, taking that next career step or trying to find your way back into the workplace after a career break, redundancy or furlough can be a daunting and challenging process.


My 10 years+ working in the recruitment industry and extensive CV/Resume writing experience have given me an excellent insight and understanding of the job search process both from a candidate perspective but more importantly from the HR & hiring managers’ viewpoint.


Your CV is the most important element of your job search “tool kit”, as it is the document that will get you through the door and into interview. Firstly, in many cases you have to bypass an ATS (Applicant Tracking System), and then a HR professional or recruitment consultant who may have dozens of applications and who will spend approximately 10 seconds reviewing your CV before they decide whether to read on or to place you in the “No” pile - and all of this happens before your CV is even shown to a hiring manager!


Writing a CV that is both optimised for ATS, engaging for the reader and relevant for the job role is not an easy task. I can help you increase your hit rate when it comes to converting job applications to interviews and beyond - my company is not a CV writing factory, rather a bespoke service that will take into consideration:


Your experience.
Your career aspirations.
Your strengths and achievements.
The current job market and the roles you are applying for.
The organisations that you want to work for.

MY SERVICE INCLUDES A 45 MINUTE TELEPHONE CONSULTATION OR BESPOKE QUESTIONNAIRE TO ENABLE ME TO GET AN IN -DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF THE ABOVE.


Add on services include:


LinkedIn health check and profile writing service - does your LinkedIn profile do you justice? Are you using LinkedIn effectively and proactively in your job search process?


Cover Letter/Email Writing - tailored to the role you are applying for - showcasing your relevant skills and personal qualities.


Interview Coaching - 2 sessions - the first focusing on past interview performance and improvements and the second, a tailored mock interview for a specific role/type of role. Both sessions will incorporate an extensive feedback form so that you will have a record of what you need to work on to become successful at interview.


I cover the following industries:


Accountancy & Finance
Sales & Marketing
Legal
Manufacturing & Production
Healthcare
HR
IT
Education


If you are sending out your CV/Resume and are not receiving interview requests or if you are getting to interview stage but not converting to job offers - please contact me today and I will give you everything you need to move your job search forward!

Patricia Ledesma,"['English', 'Spanish']","My love for literature has led me to dive into the world of writing and exploring the English language. So, for almost all my life, I have studied my mother tongue and the foreign language. Yes, I can say that, not only because of the university degree that qualifies me but also because of the experience I have gained throughout my professional career, I am bilingual. I am an English teacher with twenty-five years of experience in different educational institutions, both public and private. In this vast world, where daily obligations become tyrannical protagonists and where personal dreams float in every awakening, making joy flow giving true meaning to life, is where the passion for literature overflows uncontrollably. That continuous flow of feelings and experiences led me to publish my first book of short stories, ""De Carne y Fuego."" Winning some prizes and honorable mentions in different literature contests motivated me, and, therefore, my second book of short stories will soon see the light. But as love is tireless and seeks to satiate its appetite daily, I also dedicate myself to creating articles for websites. No matter the subject or theme, the thirst for writing quenches when I gently slide my fingers on the keyboard and allow my muse to pour on Word or WordPress what my imagination is creating. The same happens when I translate from English to Spanish or vice versa and interpret what the author is communicating. It is so crucial for those who write that their feelings are reflected in their writing paths that it would be unthinkable to transgress their words. Novels, stories, documents, every text that comes into my hands, I translate it in the same way and with the same devotion. It is not here where my love for letters ends. This tireless whirlwind of words often turns to the musical genre. I have been fortunate that several of my songs, some I can mention and others not for contract reasons, are now touring on international digital platforms, filling me with satisfaction. I have always been enthusiastic about literature and art in general. Therefore, I have produced and conducted radio programs where I have had the opportunity to interview singers, dancers, actresses, actors, theater and film directors, painters, among others. I have even organized other multitudinous cultural events; more than three hundred artists have performed on stage in some of them.

I am an aspiring freelancer and I have always liked writing and journaling and it helps me think better to put my thoughts and ideas into words. I love linguistics and I am always curious about how letters and words come together to give meaning to out thoughts. It is no wonder that English has become an international language since it is easy to learn and it easily absorbs phrases from other languages too. 
I believe that to become a good writer, one needs to be a good reader and I love reading. And I like to read a book more than once in order to fully understand what the author is trying to convey. I biased towards classic fiction authors and poets like Charles Dickens, Jane Austen and Shakespeare. I also like to read non-fiction books from contemporary authors such as Malcolm Gladwell, Jordan Peterson and Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

Amarildo Prendi,"['English', 'Albanian']","I'm a very talented social media manager with 2 years experience. As a creative communicator with seven years of industry experience including senior roles in Local Government, I am confident developing and implementing strategic communications with a focus on Social Media.

While I can confidently coordinate strategy and implementation across a broad spectrum of projects, I also offer the agility to be responsive to emerging issues and adaptive to industry trends.

I am confident my creative communication style, passion for community engagement and collaborative approach will add value and innovation to the Emergency Management Community Information team.

In 2019, I was employed by Mornington Peninsula Shire to establish and grow Council's corporate Social Media presence. This involved strategic content planning to communicate the work of varying departments across the organisation and management of all internal content editors.

During this role I delivered best practice training and provided regular guidance to the Shire’s internal Social Media Users Group (SMUG) of approximately 40 administrators managing satellite sites with localised community audiences.

While we thankfully have not experienced a major emergency during my time at the Shire, much of my work has included emergency preparedness such as developing Social Media emergency protocols, templated emergency responses and basic Crisis Works training.

I also completed a Social Media for Emergency Situations masterclass in 2017 through the Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV), which provided invaluable insight to the work of lead agencies during emergencies.

In my current role as Senior Communications Advisor, I coordinate and implement strategic communications and manage media issues across the organisation for departments including: Climate Change Energy and Water; Human Resources; Youth Services; Infrastructure Strategy; Community Support and Development and many others.

Within my portfolio I lead strategy for more than 80 projects each year, often with competing priorities, messages and stakeholders.

To deliver this volume of work on time and on message while avoiding audience fatigue, I am keenly aware of our community touch points, how to maximise the impact of our channels and balance the capacity of the Communications Team.

Relationships are vital to the success of my work, both to manage the reputation of Council and to regularly inform and empower our community to engage with key Shire activity.

While I have progressed within the organisation, the Social Media Officer role is one of my direct reports and I have retained a keen interest in and visibility of the current Social Media landscape.

I would love to translate my experience and skills to the Emergency Management Community Information team.

I look forward to speaking with you further about the capability and creativity I can bring to the role.",0.0,0,14.08,"['graphics design', 'social media management', 'html/html5', 'content writing', 'logo design', 'website design']","['Advertising', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'Technology']",0,0,17-05-2021,unknown,Shkoder, Albania,0.0,17-05-2021

During this time, I perfected my language skills whilst studying extensive language courses at Université Grenoble Alpes and Doshisha University (Kyoto). Living abroad only increased my passion for languages and cultural exchange and made me want to bring the unique literature, film, and art that I was lucky enough to experience to people all around the world through the power of translation.

Katarina Jovanovic,"['English', 'Serbian', 'Swedish']","I am a medical student in Rome, Italy. I originally come from Serbia, but I have studied in Sweden before moving to Italy to fulfil my dreams of becoming a doctor. My entire life, I have been surrounded by people from various cultures, something that sparked my interest in different traditions and ways of thinking. Consequently, I developed insatiable hunger for developing into a better world citizen.

Although my interests are highly specific, my mind is always open for hearing opinions different from mine and exploring ways to incorporate this newfound knowledge across my pre-existing areas of knowledge. Something that helped me develop this skill was studying the theory of knowledge as a subject.

From the young age I have enjoyed writing poetry in my mother tongue. My favourite assignments are formal writings such as replications of scientific studies, formal letters, or essays based on well researched content. I have also had experience translating educational content from English to Serbian and peer-reviewing my colleagues' work.

Languages spoken:
1. Serbian - mother tongue
2. English - excellent (I have been studying in English since 2012)
3. Swedish - level C (however, I find translating to Swedish difficult)
4. Italian - beginner

Robert Hamburg,"['English', 'Spanish']","Hello from London!

Are you looking for a top-notch copywriter, who captures the attention of your readers, with truly inspirational content? Or, one who can craft a killer headline that blows up the comments on social media? Well, I believe that with my skills and experience - I'm who you're looking for.

You can find samples of my work on my personal portfolio page https://robhamburg0.journoportfolio.com/

My rates account for platform fees, currency conversions and withdrawal fees.

I know that you'll find cheaper copywriters than me on on here, but the ones who take on projects for peanuts simply won't do a good enough job — they'll do a half-job/send you spun content/get another writer to do the work for them — or some combination of the three.

What you want is copy that resonates with your target audience, converts — and ideally — puts smiles on faces. Now ain't that worth paying a little extra for? :D

Now that we've got that out of the way, I'll briefly fill you in on my experience. I have over 4 years of experience as a copywriter and digital marketer. My experience has included:

 Short- and long-form article writing
 Designing and writing copy for product and service landing pages
 Writing product descriptions
 Social media ads for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn
 Email outreach campaigns
 Google AdWords
 YouTube video scripts, titles, descriptions and thumbnails

I've written copy for several niches, which mainly fall into:

 Hospitality and leisure
 Travel
 Language learning
 Health and fitness
 Finance
 Saas
 Ecommerce
 Digital marketing

My skills and experience have moulded me into a savvy and commercially aware digital marketing creative; I've given advice on other areas of marketing, such as on creating a content plan, competitor analysis and social media strategy.

Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and if there's anything else you'd like to know, just drop me a message and I'll get back to you.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Miranda Sajdak,['English'],"When I was growing up, I knew I wanted to work creatively, to inspire others, and to make positive change in the world. After graduating from Barnard College/Columbia University, I’ve managed to check a lot of those boxes, becoming an award-winning screenwriter, screenwriting consultant, and advocate for diversity within the film and television spaces.

As a screenplay analyst, I’ve read thousands of scripts and books for television and film companies, with clients including Walden Media, Amazon, and writers who have worked for ABC Family, Dimension, FX, Hallmark, Rideback, Bold Films, Practical Pictures, and many more. I’ve been a screenwriting instructor through online classes at the Writer’s Store and my own company, Harbor Road Entertainment, which I founded to help companies and individual clients with screenplay consultation, including a heavy focus on diversity & inclusion in writing, and pitching projects.

I understand the notes process from a writer’s perspective; my own work has won multiple contests, including The Quest Initiative (2013), The Next MacGyver (2015), and the Sony PlayStation Emerging Filmmakers Contest (2017). Through those awards and more, I’ve optioned a TV pilot to Ridley Scott’s company Scott Free, and had another produced by PlayStation in 2018.

In my spare time, my passion for directing has led me to oversee a number of short films, and I was honored to be picked for Ryan Murphys 2019 Half Initiative, as a mentee under director Dan Minahan. I shadowed Dan on the season finale of Ratched, getting to observe in prep and on set through the entire episode.
